A Simple Script for Rubber Ducky which Exploits Windows $MFT Vulnerability $MFT is used by NTFS 
systems to manage some metadata. This fallace has recently been discovered, which has not yet 
been closed. Works on windows 7, 8 and vista, dont work on windows 10. I think work on Xp and 
earlier. This Script dont require any special firmware on the Rubber Ducky (TwinDuck Firmare etc.).
The system crash lasts until the machine is switched off, or until the blue screen of death 
appears;)

A system crash demonstration using the two strings with the following paths: 
c:$MFT & c:$MFT\123 can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYL9UQRwUZc&t=6s
